        Here's what I like about lists:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>That's about it</li>
            <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>
        When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
            <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
            <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                <ul>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
        </ol>
